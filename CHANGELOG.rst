0.6.0 (2016-09-18)
------------------
* New filter engine based on Pandas rather than Numexpr. This enables new types of filters in the where
  clause (see below). By default the old engine is still used but the new one can be enabled either
  by default on server startup or on a per-query basis by setting the new 'X-QCache-filter-engine' header
  to 'pandas'.
* New bitwise filters in the 'pandas' filter engine, 'all_bits' and 'any_bits'.
* New string filters, 'like' and 'ilike' which corresponds roughly to LIKE in SQL with the addition
  of regex support. 'like' is case sensitive while 'ilike' is case insensitive.

0.5.0 (2016-06-19)
------------------
* New header when uploading data, 'X-QCache-stand-in-columns', that let you specify default values
  for columns that may not be present in the uploaded data.
