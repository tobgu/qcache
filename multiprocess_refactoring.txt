TODO
----
- Add measurements and metrics to the different parts of the processing that are returned as
  a header in the response.
- Proper error handling if shard or l2 crashes
- Fix status endpoint to check l2 cache if exists
- Test what happens if worker process fails
- Zmq errors
- Measure L2 impact


Semantic differences
--------------------
- Sub select handling of NaN values. Previously used to
  include NaNs. Now it does not. This is more inline with
  SQL.
- Python 3. Aliases cannot be set to strings for the moment
  this may change in the future to be possible again.
