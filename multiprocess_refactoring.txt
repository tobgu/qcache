TODO
----
- Proper error handling if shard or l2 crashes
- Test what happens if worker process fails
- Zmq errors
- Measure L2 impact
- More transport threads if L2 cache?

Semantic differences
--------------------
- Sub select handling of NaN values. Previously used to
  include NaNs. Now it does not. This is more inline with
  SQL.
- Python 3. Aliases cannot be set to strings for the moment
  this may change in the future to be possible again.
- Prefer using ',' to separate multiple values for the same header
  instead of ';' which is deprecated and will be removed.
